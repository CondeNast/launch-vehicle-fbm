## Why are we doing this?

Does everyone understand the problem this pull request is solving? This may just be a
restatement of the ticket. Think of your audience; could someone not familiar
with the language understand? A non-technical person? Remember that this will
be preserved forever in the git history.

## Did you document your work?

elsewhere? (Wiki/comments/"npm script")?

## How can someone test these changes?

Steps to manually verify the change:

1. ARRANGE
2. ACT
3. ASSERT

## What possible risks or adverse effects are there?

If applicable, include a technical debt note. Do a quick estimate of if this pull request increases or decreases technical debt. Leave a message to future developers about why increased technical debt is worth it, or brag about how you figured out how to reduce technical debt.

## What are the follow-up tasks?

* Was there something you postponed but want to revisit?
* Is there an artifact that needs to be deployed?
* Is there a change to Jenkins that needs to be made?
* Is there something to do out-of-band after this is landed?
* Do you need to update the release notes?

## Are there any known issues?

## Did the test coverage decrease?

_(Optional)_ Test coverage: increasing test coverage is important to us. If you let test
coverage slip, you have to justify it.
